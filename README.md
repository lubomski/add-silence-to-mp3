add-silence-to-mp3
==================

This is a bash script which leverages [Sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to add 1 second of silence to the beginning and end an existing .mp3 file.

All converted files will be in the new subdirectory "converted" inside the directory where this script is executed; the original files will not be touched.

I put this script together to batch process hundreds of audio files at work. It's not pretty but it works well!
